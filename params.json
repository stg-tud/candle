{"name":"Candle","tagline":"Comprehension Assessment for Newly Developed LanguagEs","body":"### Assessing program comprehension.\r\nAssessing program comprehension in controlled experiments is a difficult task at scale. Researchers that opt for traditional IDEs in their experiments need to individually supervise each experiment session and carefully report execution times for each comprehension task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Candle\r\nCandle automatizes the process of showing new comprehension tasks to subjects and measure comprehension time. Researchers can organize their studies in multiple tasks, add explanation pages and preliminary training tasks. Candle is Web-bases hence it does not require installation. Hence Candle can easily scale to large experiments involving hundreds of developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nGuido Salvaneschi, Sven Amann, Sebastian Proksch, Mira Mezini, An Empirical Study on Program Comprehension with Reactive Programming, International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2014.\r\n\r\n### About \r\nCanlde is a projects developed at TU Darmstadt, Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-74323105-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
